## Usage
"Alexa ask bin man which bin should I put out next?"

Alexa will respond with either the green bin or recycling bin depending on the week as defined [here](https://www.hartlepool.gov.uk/downloads/file/1899/tuesday_week_1_calendarpdf).

The assumed bin day is Tuesday, and it is assumed recycling and general rubbish bins are collected on alternate weeks.
